# SalyPath360 :  Saliency and Scanpath Prediction Framework forOmnidirectional Images

# Abstract : 
This paper introduces a new framework to predict visual attentionof omnidirectional images. The key setup of our architecture isthe simultaneous prediction of the saliency map and a correspond-ing scanpath for a given stimulus. The framework implements afully encoder-decoder convolutional neural network augmented byan attention module to generate representative saliency maps. Inaddition, an auxiliary network is employed to generate probableviewport center fixation points through the𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝐴𝑟𝑔𝑀𝑎𝑥function.The latter allows to derive fixation points from feature maps. To takeadvantage of the scanpath prediction, an adaptive joint probabilitydistribution model is then applied to construct the final unbiasedsaliency map by leveraging the encoder decoder-based saliency mapand the scanpath-based saliency heatmap. The proposed frameworkwas evaluated in terms of saliency and scanpath prediction, and theresults were compared to state-of-the-art methods on Salient360!dataset. The results showed the relevance of our framework andthe benefits of such architecture for further omnidirectional visualattention prediction tasks.
